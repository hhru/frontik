## What is Frontik?

Frontik is an asyncronous Tornado-based application server. It was designed to support simple xml aggregation with xsl
transformation, but supports other content types as well.

Frontik was originally developed by Andrey Tatarinov at [hh.ru][hh] as a part of infrastructure development tasks.

## How does it work?

      |       |--\      |        |
      |       |  | xsl  |        |
      |       |<-/      |        |
      |       |         |        |
      |    (done)       |        |
      |<------|         |        |
      |       |         |        |

Typically page generation process is split into several steps:

  * initiate requests: frontik makes several http-requests to underlying backends
  * wait for response (or timeout) for each backend request
  * aggregate all responses and apply xsl transformation or construct result in any other way (see [Producers](docs/producers.md))
  * return the result to user after postprocessing (see [Postprocessing](docs/postprocessing.md))

## Usages

  * All pages of [hh.ru][http://hh.ru/] are served with frontik
