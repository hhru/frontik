## Postprocessing

Postprocessing is a mechanism for final modifications to be applied to a response. The most obvious use-case is
replacing translation placeholders with real localized values.

Postprocessor can be added at any stage of request hanldling:

```python
self.add_early_postprocessor(postprocessor)
self.add_late_postprocessor(postprocessor)
```

where ```postprocessor``` is a callable:

```python
def postprocessor(handler, callback):
    callback()
```

There are three types of postprocessors in Frontik:

_Early postprocessors_ are called just after all requests are done (the main AsyncGroup is finished). They are ideal
for general checks that can immediately interrupt request handling (for example make redirect or throw HTTPError) â€” in
such case no time would be wasted on templating and producing the response. Note that early postprocessing will be
skipped if any unhandled error occurs earlier.

_Late postprocessors_ are guaranteed to run at the very end of request handling (just before flushing the result).
You could use them in order to make last-minute amends to the response (for example, add headers or write something
useful to the log).

_Template postprocessors_ could be used for modifying the response text after the actual templating. Template
postprocessor callable receives additional parameter containing the result of templating
(see [Content types and producers](docs/producers.md)).

If any postprocessor fails, the page would be finished with an error.

```python
def postprocessor(handler, template, callback):
    callback(template.replace('foo', 'bar'))

self.add_template_postprocessor(postprocessor)
```

```callback``` must be called when the work is done, with the result of postprocessing as an only argument.
Postprocessing can also be interrupted by throwing an exception or just calling ```self.redirect``` or
```self.finish()``` methods, which explicitly generate the response.

Postprocessors are executed one after another in the order of their addition. Default postprocessor is set from the
```postprocessor``` variable of the application config file (see [Configuring application](docs/configure-app.md)).
